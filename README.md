# What you need

any GUI would do, make sure to change the items you want to tween are edited in GUI Methods file.

(For Roblox's Game Engine)


EX:

--Things you want to tween: 

local frame1 = GUI.Frame

local text = GUI.Frame.DojoT

local text2 = GUI.Frame.Info


# Whats the point?

This is my take on the whole make a GUI appear when a person enters an area ordeal. It's simple, though not complete. Theres some bugs to fix but not huge, just minor details.
